# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp (CHEM280)

To make a commit ("version" or "checkpoint") of your files, following this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you'd like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using the 'git add FILENAME' command.
3. Create a checkpoint of your file using 'git commit -m "Message about what you did"'.
